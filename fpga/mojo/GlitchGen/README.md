# Glitch Generation

**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, FOR NOW DOESN'T WORK**

It generates a clock with a base frequency of 16MHz that can be programmatically
be glitched (time and width). It is intended to be used for an Arduino like
board.

It's inspired by the article "An on-chip glitchy-clock generator and its application to safe-error attack",
in particular its internals.
